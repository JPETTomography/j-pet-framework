 * This method whites all TObject-based objects contained in the TCollection-based container (see ROOT documentation)
 * into a directory whose name is given by dirname inside the output file. If dirname does not exist
 * in the output file, it will be created. Otherwise, contents of the col collection will be appended to an existing
 * directory.
 *
 * If the optional subdirectory name is specified (subdirname parameter, defaults to empty string) then the 
 * contents of the collection will be written to "dirname/subdirname". If the "subdirname" directory does not
 * exist inside the "dirname" directory, it will be created.
