 * @brief Data class representing a signal during its physical reconstruction
 *
 * JPetRecoSignal is one level higher than JPetRawSignal. It represents the signal
 * during physical reconstruction of its shape and properties.
 * This class contains fields intended to store the complete shape of the signal
 * as well as properties such as amplitude, charge (from TOT), delay, etc.
 *
 * Processing of data from the Scope should start with this class rather than JPetRawSignal.
 *
 * Reconstructed signal properties stored in this class should be used to produce a JPetPhysSignal.
