# J-PET Analysis Framework

## What is it?

**J-PET Analysis Framework** is a flexible analysis environment which serves as a backbone system
for the reconstruction algorithms and calibration procedures used during the data processing
and standardizes the common operations, e.g: input/output process, access to the detector
geometry parameters and more. It is written in C++ using the object-oriented approach.
It is based on the ROOT libraries combined with some BOOST packages. The quality of the code
is assured by the automatized set of unit tests. The documentation of the code is generated by Doxygen.

## Latest Version

The latest stable version can be downloaded from the github repository. You must have git client installed and do:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/JPETTomography/j-pet-framework.git myFramework
```

## Documentation

The code documentation can be generated with Doxygen package using:

```
make documentation
```
in the build directory. The `index.html` file will be available in the `html/` directory located inside the build directory.

## Installation

Please see the file called [INSTALL](INSTALL).
