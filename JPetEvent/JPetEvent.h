/**
 * @brief Data class representing an event from a single emission.
 *
 * An event consists of one or more  hits (JPetHit objects) registered in barrel slots.
 * The class constructor and setHits by default order hits in the ascending time order.
 * This behaviour can be turned off by the orderedByTime flag.
 * Also, when using addHit method the order is not guaranteed anymore.
 * It Is the user responsability to assure it when using addHit method.
 * The event type corresponds to the category of physical process e.g. 2 gamma or 3 gamma decay
 * A given type can be a logical combination of several types by using bit OR operators
 * e.g. static_cast<JPetEventType>(JPetEventType::kGamma2|JPetEventType::kScattered).
 * This means, that at given moment we don't know to which type it belongs.
