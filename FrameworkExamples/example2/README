Simple program showing how to run an analysis using as input a raw (unpacked) data file.

Compile & run
-------------
Just type:
make
./run.sh
or
./main.x -t hld -f xx13324155401.hld

Expected output
---------------
The unpacked  xx13324155401.hld.root file should be created.

Description
--------------
The executable main.x must be called with certain flags:
-t hld                -> input file has the hld format
-f xx13324155401.hld  -> name of the input file
The full line:
./main.x -t hld -f xx13324155401.hld

The program doesnt do much, just converts the hld file into root file.

Additional info
--------------
The hld format is a file format for raw or unpacked data coming from the DAQ system.
To be readible it must be converted to a root tree file by 
the program called Unpacker. The Unpacker was written by Grzegorz Korcyl.
J-PET framework only calls it to automatically unpack files.
Some settings for the unpacker are in JPetUnpacker/Unpacker2/conf.xml file.

Description
------------
The example shows how to run the analysis using a raw hld file.
The arguments are passed via command line when we call the main program.
The hld file will be unpacked via Unpacker, and the root file with the unpacked data will be loaded.

Compiling 
------------
make

Running
------------
To run the program type:
 ./main.x -t hld -f xx13324155401.hld

-t flag is used to define type of the input file (hld in the example)
-f flag is used to to define a name of the input file

Alternatively you can call 
./run.sh 
which contains exactly the same sets of parameters
