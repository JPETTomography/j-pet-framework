Show how to create new unit test of a class ABClass and how to run the code

Expected output
---------------
New directory ABClassTest with predifined:
Makefile
ABClassTest.cpp


Description
--------------
Use createTest script to generate a predefined code which 
will be placed in ABClassTest directory.
Use script run_tests.pl to run all the defined tests.

Additional info
--------------
Important, directories name that contain unit test code should finish with
"Test", because run_tests.pl use it to determine which folders contain tests. 
This suffix is added automatically by createTest script.

Compiling 
------------
Call Makefile from the main directory (tests) to compile all tests 
OR
enter to chosen folder and call the Makefile to compile a given test

Running
------------
To create a new unit test folder of class ABClass call:
./createTest ABClass
The folder ABClassTest will be created.
Next, add the appropriate test code into ABClassTest/ABClassTest.cpp
and modify ABClassTest/Makefile if needed. 

To run all tests use perl script run_tests.pl
./run_tests.pl
It should invoke all the tests from subfolders.
One can also define the BOOST information level (all, error) e.g.
./run_tests.pl all 
will display more detailed information about performed tests.
