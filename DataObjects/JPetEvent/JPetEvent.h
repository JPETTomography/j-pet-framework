/**
 * @brief Data class representing an event, that took place during
 * the measurement with J-PET detector.
 *
 * An event consists of one or more JPetHits, registered in barrel slots.
 * The class constructor and setHits method by default order the hits
 * in the ascending time order. This behaviour can be turned off by
 * the orderedByTime flag. Also, when using addHit method the order
 * is NOT guaranteed anymore. It is the users responsibility to sort it in
 * (or not) during the reconstrution/analysis procedures.
 * The JPetEvent can be flagged with a type (JPetEventType enum),
 * that corresponds to the category of physical process e.g. 2, 3 gamma decay.
 * A given type can be a logical combination of several types by using
 * bit OR operators. This option can be used for instatnce to flag that
 * the final type of the event is yet undecided or it contains hits
 * from several separate physical events.
