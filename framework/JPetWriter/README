how to use JPetWriter:

1. Create the instance of your JPetWriter. You will use it to write
   data to a single file. As an rgument for constructor, pass
   it's name.
   
   IMPORTANT:
   If the file already exists, it will be overwritten.

2. After the file had been opened. Use one of two methods to write
   objects to it:

	a) Write(const T& object);
	   To write a single object to it.

	b) Write(std::vector<T> & vect);
	   To write a whole vector of objects to it.

   IMPORTANT:
   Both write methods shown above are templated methods, but that
   DOESN'T mean, that you can write any object to the file.
   It will be best if you stay with classes from the inside of our
   framework, that inherit from TNamed.

3. After the work is done, use:
	CloseFile();
   method to avoid any data corruption.
   Unfortunately at the moment the writer is not reusable :(
