     J-PET Analysis Framework 

What is it ?
------------

J-PET Analysis Framewore is a flexible analysis framework which serves as a backbone system for the reconstruction algorithms and calibration procedures used during the data processing and standardize the common operations, e.g: input/output process, access to the detector geometry parameters and more.
It is written in C++ using the object-oriented approach. It is based on the ROOT libraries combined with some BOOST packages. The quality of the code is assured by the automatized set of unit tests. The documentation of the code is generated by Doxygen.

The Latest Version
