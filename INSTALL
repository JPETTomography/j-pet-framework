Basic installation
------------------

  1. Install the required libraries and tools.
     Refer to the 'Requirements' section of this document for details.
     You can find ready commands for some systems in the
     'Requirements installation' section.

  2. Create a directory where the built programs will be placed, e.g.
     in the main directory:

     mkdir build
     cd build

  3. Invoke the CMake build tool and provide the path to the main directory
     If you created the build directory in the main one and entered 'build'
     as in step 2. then do:

     cmake ..

  4. To compile the J-PET framework library do:

     make

  5. Once the compilation is finished, there should be a file
     'libJPetFramework.so' in the build directory.

Code documentation
------------------

To generate the code documentation of the J-PET Framework library,
the Doxygen software must be installed.

To generate the documentation just go to the j-pet-framework build directory
and do:

  make documentation

and the documentation will be generated and put in folders named latex and html inside the build directory.
