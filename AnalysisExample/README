This example show a full dummy analysis of data from J-PET. This analysis example was created for 2 types of J-PET data listed below, but it should work with any dataset without big changes.
 * data from small barrel, cosmic rays
 * data from 2-strip setup with collimated source beam in the middle of strips

JPet.log file appears with the log of the processing and ROOT files with the following etensions are produced:
 *.tslot.raw.root
 *.tslot.cal.root
 *.raw.sig.root
 *.reco.sig.root
 *.phys.sig.root
 *.phys.hit.root
 *.phys.eve.root

* stands for the name of the input file, which in this example is one of the following:
 cosm_barrel.hld.root
 2stripMid.hld.root

Description
--------------
The analysis is split into modules, from A to E.

Additional info
--------------


Compiling 
------------

Running
------------
To run 2 simple examples:
